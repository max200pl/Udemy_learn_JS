# Short --- Summary

1. Abstraction -> Messing with details

2. Encapsulation -> Using encapsulation logic -> using privet methods and privet variables

3. Inheritance -> Using one parent class and one child class when this classes are closely related.

4. Polymorphism -> Using method when taken in sister structure, overwriting them.

# OOP in js

1.  Each object has a prototype
2.  Prototype inheritance:
    The prototype contains methods (behavior) that are accessible to all objects linked to that prototype.

# Create new object in js

1. ES6 Classes:
   1.1 "Syntactic sugar": behind the scenes, ES6 classes work exactly like constructor functions;
   1.2 ES6 classes do NOT behave like classes in "classical OOP";

2. Object.create():
   Which is basically the easiest most straightforward way;
